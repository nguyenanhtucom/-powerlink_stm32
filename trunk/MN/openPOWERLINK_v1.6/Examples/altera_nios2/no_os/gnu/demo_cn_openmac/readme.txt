	openPOWERLINK - Demo for EBV DBC3C40 with openMAC
	==================================================


Contents
---------

- Demo for Controlled Node as standalone program on Nios II CPU.


Performance Data
-----------------

- Minimum cycle length: 400 µs
- PReq-PRes Latency: 1 µs


Requirements
-------------

- Development Board EBV DBC3C40 (Mercury Board)

- Altera Quartus II v9.0 or newer (Web Edition is also possible)

- Altera Nios II Embedded Design Suite v9.0 or newer

- Experiences with this development environment are required

- POWERLINK network as described in main readme.txt


How to build the binary
------------------------

1. Open "Nios II Command Shell"

2. Go to this subdirectory of openPOWERLINK:

    $ cd Examples\altera_nios2\no_os\gnu\demo_cn_openmac

3. Run script create-this-app to create the Makefile for
   the demo application and the necessary BSP.
   (This step is only necessary once)

    $ ./create-this-app

4. Run make to build the ELF file after changing the sources.
   (The script create-this-app will do this automatically)

    $ make

5. Rebuild the Makefile for the demo application and the
   BSP, if the Nios II Design was changed inside the SOPC Builder.

    $ ./create-this-app --rebuild


How to run the demo
--------------------

1. Setup the POWERLINK network as described in main readme.txt located in
   openPOWERLINK main directory.

2. Program SOF file with Quartus II Programmer into FPGA.
   It is located in the following subdirectory of openPOWERLINK
   main directory:
   \Examples\altera_nios2\EBV_DBC3C40\design_nios2_openmac\nios_openMac.sof

3. Download the ELF file to the target:

    $ cd Examples\altera_nios2\no_os\gnu\demo_cn_openmac
    $ make download-elf

4. Enjoy the running POWERLINK network.


How to import the project into Nios II IDE for debugging purposes
