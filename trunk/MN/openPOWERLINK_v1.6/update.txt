How to update from any previous version to version 1.6
-------------------------------------------------------

1. PDO user part module is always necessary now, because it actually reads,
   checks and prepares the PDO configuration from the object dictionary for
   efficient processing by the PDO kernel part module.

   - Add the source files EplPdouCal.c and EplPdou.c to your project, i.e. makefile.
   - Add the constant EPL_MODULE_PDOU to the definition of EPL_MODULE_INTEGRATION
     in EplCfg.h of your project.
   - Add the OD callback function EplPdouCbObdAccess to the PDO objects (index 0x1400 - 0x1AFF)
     in your objdict.h. E.g.

        EPL_OBD_BEGIN_INDEX_RAM(0x1400, 0x03, EplPdouCbObdAccess)


2. To enable PRes cross-traffic on pure CNs it is necessary to define the
   macro EPL_DLL_PRES_FILTER_COUNT in EplCfg.h of your project. This macro
   defines the number of PRes filter entries in the DLL module and Ethernet
   driver. A value of -1 enables the reception of all PRes frames without
   specific filtering.
   Additionally, you need to include and properly configure objects
   0x1F81 NMT_NodeAssignment_AU32 and 0x1F8D NMT_PResPayloadLimitList_AU16
   in the local object dictionary for PRes cross-traffic.


3. Implement the function EdrvChangeFilter in your Ethernet driver.
   This new function will replace the functions EdrvDefineRxMacAddrEntry and
   EdrvUndefineRxMacAddrEntry in the future. Consider implementing EdrvChangeFilter.
   Currently, just a dummy like the following code snippet is sufficient.

tEplKernel EdrvChangeFilter(tEdrvFilter*    pFilter_p,
                            unsigned int    uiCount_p,
                            unsigned int    uiEntryChanged_p,
                            unsigned int    uiChangeFlags_p)
{
tEplKernel      Ret = kEplSuccessful;

    return Ret;
}
